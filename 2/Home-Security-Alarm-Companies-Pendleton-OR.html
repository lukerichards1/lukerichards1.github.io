Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or subscribe to a security element as a part of a "clever home" bundle; these technologies depend on user passwords to arm and disarm them.

Make sure to change the made password credentials right away upon invoice and change them with a passphrase that can not be quickly guessed. If you go on vacation and have someone coming by to check or feed pets on your home, set a short-lived password and reset it as quickly as you return.
