<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody!
