<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
