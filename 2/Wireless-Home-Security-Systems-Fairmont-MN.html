The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
