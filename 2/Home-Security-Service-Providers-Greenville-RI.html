We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
