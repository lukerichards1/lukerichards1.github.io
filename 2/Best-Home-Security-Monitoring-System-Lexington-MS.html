<p>This absolutely depends upon your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll require more sensing units and equipment than somebody who lives in a studio apartment. ADT's higher-tier strategies do cost more than many other alarm companies-- plus they require a $99 installation charge-- however if you need a lot of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's probably worth it. And given that ADT provides same- and next-day installation, you can get that additional security in no time, which looks like good value.</p>
