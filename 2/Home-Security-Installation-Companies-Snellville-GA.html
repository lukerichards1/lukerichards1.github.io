Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>Canary has actually overcome some initial software issues to provide a really decent security camera choice: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of vision, night vision and motion alerts (plus clear audio).

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still typical grievances.
