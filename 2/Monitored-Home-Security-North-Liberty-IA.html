<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must supply at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with recording gaps during essential security occasions.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
