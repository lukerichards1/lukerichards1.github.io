<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less likely to commit crime if they believe they are being watched or have a higher risk of being captured.

CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be lowered by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the wrongdoer needs to know the included surveillance for it to achieve its desired effect.</p>

<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was invented for homeowners.
