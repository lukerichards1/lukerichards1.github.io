By combining LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the industry. During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to set up and use-- but not quite as basic as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>

Still, what you get for the cash is all the usual Arlo traits in terms of the strong develop quality, excellent camera footage, lots of clever functions and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
