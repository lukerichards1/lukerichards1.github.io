<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my cellular phone however had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 each month for individual detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage as much as 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
