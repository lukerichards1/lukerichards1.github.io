We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.
