Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
