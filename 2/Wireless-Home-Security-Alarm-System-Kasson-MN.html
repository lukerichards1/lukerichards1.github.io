<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the maker's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? Having a hardwired security system set up may be a simpler and more economical option if so. But if your home presently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one gets rid of the requirement for drilling into your walls and also gives you the alternative of a Do It Yourself install.
