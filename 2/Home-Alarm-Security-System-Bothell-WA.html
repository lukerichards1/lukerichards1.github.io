<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature.

HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
