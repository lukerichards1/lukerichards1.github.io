<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
