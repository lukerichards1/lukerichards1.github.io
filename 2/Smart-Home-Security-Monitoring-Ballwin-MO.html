<p>If you are interested in a 4K camera system, you ideally will have a very high-speed Internet connection and a robust home network, ideally an enterprise-grade network. As talked about above, the 4K camera images are huge, which is a great deal of data to push around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that listed below). Rely on your HTA Licensed innovation specialist for suggestions here, as they will be able to figure out if a 4K camera system will work in your situation.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
