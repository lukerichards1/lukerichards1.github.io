The panel and sensing units are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so all in all a lot.</p>
<p>You can discover two kinds of security systems: professionally monitored and unmonitored. In the previous, when an alarm goes off, an expert monitoring company gets a notification and after that attempts to contact you and, if need be, your local emergency situation services. An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you. That means you need to be on call, day and night, during work and getaway time, and all set to identify whether authorities, fire departments, or other emergency services need to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge difference, and a professionally monitored system is fundamentally more secure than an unmonitored or self-monitored  one.</p>
