<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video.

<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."
