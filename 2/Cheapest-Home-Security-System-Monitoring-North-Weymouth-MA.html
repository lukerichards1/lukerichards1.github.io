Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
