<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
