<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are trying to find in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective service for catching wrongdoers and gathering proof.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
