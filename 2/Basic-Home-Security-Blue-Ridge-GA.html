If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can only watch one. This develops a one in three chance of catching a particular incident on video (either live or recorded).

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to family pets weighing as much as 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can customize the level of sensitivity level based on your family pet's size.</p>
