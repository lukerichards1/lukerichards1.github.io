<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be viewed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
