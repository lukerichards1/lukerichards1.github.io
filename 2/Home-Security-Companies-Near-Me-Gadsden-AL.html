If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed homes) a ineffective and pricey technique to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
