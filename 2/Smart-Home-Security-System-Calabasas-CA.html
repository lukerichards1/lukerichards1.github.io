However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time routinely disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>
