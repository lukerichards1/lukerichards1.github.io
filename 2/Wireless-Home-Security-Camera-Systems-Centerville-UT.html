Tenants, unlike house owners, generally prevent making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.

Window sensors are quickly concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.

Wireless systems are likewise ideal for occupants since they do not require opening the wall, and can easily be taken with you when you relocate to your next location.
