<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to recommend as a top choice.</p>

If you currently own a Ring video doorbell and wish to expand your home security protection, including Ring Alarm makes good sense. When you include other Ring products to Sound Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and clever lighting. Obviously, at that point, the cheap price ends up being more expensive.</p>
