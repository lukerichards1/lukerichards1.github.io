<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and pricey approach to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
