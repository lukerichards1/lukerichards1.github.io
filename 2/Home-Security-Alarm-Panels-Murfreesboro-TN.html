<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are difficult to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to purchase an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>

Many wired security systems have professional monitoring but do not have access to remote monitoring. Given that the system is more like a landline than a cellphone, the system is not able to connect to an app on your mobile phone.

<p>Even though 1080p is generally the basic resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
