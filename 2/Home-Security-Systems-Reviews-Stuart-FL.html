No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
