<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be careful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies."
