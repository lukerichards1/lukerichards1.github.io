<p>Most security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They generally have the same functions like night vision or remote watching, but they differ in durability. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and sometimes, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices since their style allows for minimum glare.
