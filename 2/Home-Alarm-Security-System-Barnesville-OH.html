<p>We love the benefit and versatility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free.

<p>For how long does it normally take to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I use VOIP today. May move to cellular eventually in the future but sticking with dial-up for now.
