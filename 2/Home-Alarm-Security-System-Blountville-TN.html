<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a great alternative for a cheap home security system with wise home assistance. However perhaps skip the cameras for now. Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems providing growth and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand eliminate to transfer the data? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
