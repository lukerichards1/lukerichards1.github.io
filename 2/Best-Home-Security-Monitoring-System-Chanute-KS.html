<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
