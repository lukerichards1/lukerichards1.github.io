<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
