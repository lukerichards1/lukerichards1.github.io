As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
