Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
