<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
