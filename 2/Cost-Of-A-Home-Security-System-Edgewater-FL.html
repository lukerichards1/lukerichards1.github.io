<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
