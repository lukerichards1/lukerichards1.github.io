The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we may revisit this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud.
