<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

For someone looking for a more complicated setup like home automation, or someone that desires a trained expert to make the suggestion for the setup, professional installation is an excellent option. We've found that the majority of people that were apprehensive about self installing a home security system actually wound up discovering the procedure really simple.
