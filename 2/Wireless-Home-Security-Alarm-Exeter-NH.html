<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
