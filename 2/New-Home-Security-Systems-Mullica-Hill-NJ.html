<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>
