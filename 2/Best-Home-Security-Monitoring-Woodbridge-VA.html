<p>You can likewise buy individual equipment piecemeal if you 'd rather monitor your own home security system, or test out the idea prior to dedicating to full automation. In that case, the cost of purchasing each piece-- cameras, thermostat, center, door locks-- will begin to accumulate, with a few hundred dollars here and there, however you will not have to maintain regular monthly monitoring costs. Don't DIY your smart home security system - the pros at Vivint are absolutely worth the cost.</p>
<p>While all plans include the Frontpoint app, to unlock video surveillance and advanced wise tech functions, you'll require its $50-per-month Ultimate plan. That's a high cost for home automation when compared to rivals like Vivint, which lets you add those features at every tier (beginning at $40 per month). Think about buying a standalone security camera if you opt for a package that does not consist of live video surveillance. The best home security cameras on the marketplace range in price, but typical around $200.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
