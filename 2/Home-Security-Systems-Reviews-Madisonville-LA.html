<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, felines shriek, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power.</p>
