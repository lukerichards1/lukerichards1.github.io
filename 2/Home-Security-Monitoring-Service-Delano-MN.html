Since it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
