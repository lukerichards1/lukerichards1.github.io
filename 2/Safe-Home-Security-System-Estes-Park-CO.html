<p>When it concerns innovation, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which functions and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still typical grievances. Hardwired systems need very little upkeep, and short of a general power interruption, are more difficult to interfere with.
