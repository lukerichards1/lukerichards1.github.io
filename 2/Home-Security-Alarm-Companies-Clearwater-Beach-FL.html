<p>Home security systems and contemporary wise home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to tap into their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>Although 1080p is normally the basic resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
