<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm System in California</h3>
<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for example, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was caught using cops databases to gather info on clients of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of parking area at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were married. Imagine what someone like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>We likewise love that Ring still has decent clever home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home devices like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your general security system. With the advances in innovation, monitoring a home security system is relatively easy. Because the security systems alert house owners to suspicious activity through a mobile phone, monitoring a home is as easy as checking a text.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
