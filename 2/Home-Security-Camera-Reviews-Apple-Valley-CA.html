<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
