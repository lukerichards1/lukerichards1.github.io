<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
