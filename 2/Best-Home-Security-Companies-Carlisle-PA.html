<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
