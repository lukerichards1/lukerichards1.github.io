<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list simply since if you don't understand it, you will lose huge. Intelligent innovation understands the distinction.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>The 720p camera provides a 172-degree view and color night vision. You can save the videos on the base system instead of the cloud. The integrated MicroSD card can store around 9 hours of video on a 4 GB card.
