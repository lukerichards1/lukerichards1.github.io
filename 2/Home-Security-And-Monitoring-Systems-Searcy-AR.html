<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a complete home security system.

You will not have to fret about it taping or sending out an alert every time the pet dog strolls by if the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location. (We believe this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles frequently pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Camera.</p>
