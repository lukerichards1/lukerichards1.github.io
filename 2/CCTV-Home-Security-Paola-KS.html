<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.
