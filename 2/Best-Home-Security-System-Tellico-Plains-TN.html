Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is costly, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
