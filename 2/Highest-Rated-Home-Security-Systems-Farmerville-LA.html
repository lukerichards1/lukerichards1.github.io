Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
