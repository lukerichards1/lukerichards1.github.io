<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video clips in the cloud.

<p>Flood lights are often used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors discover movement, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will enable you to see who is on your home and will potentially scare off intruders. Much better outdoor lighting also implies a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, think about the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can hinder vandals or frighten them away, but as a single tool, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
