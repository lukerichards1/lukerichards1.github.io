The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the truth, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard disk space of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to spend more money.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
