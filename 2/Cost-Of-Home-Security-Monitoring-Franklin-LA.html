A Few Of Google Nest's cameras do use facial acknowledgment, but they can't trip alarms (based upon whether they acknowledge somebody or otherwise). Some alarm companies intentionally program communication delays into their home alarm system. These delays, which can be as long as 4 minutes, are set up to minimize incorrect alarms. Our systems are configured so that we receive your alarm signal immediately.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over cross countries.

When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>

The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the fact, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays.
