The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>A system that requires a contract might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of complimentary storage, and use two AA batteries that can last approximately two years. Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and supply physical proof like camera video or a broken window to call for police response.</p>
