<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
