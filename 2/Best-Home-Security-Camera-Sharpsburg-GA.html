<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
