<p>Local storage: Some cameras consist of memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can keep video right on the device.

Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually get rid of to transfer the data? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you desire the information to be backed up in multiple locations.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
