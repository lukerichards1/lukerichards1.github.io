We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.
