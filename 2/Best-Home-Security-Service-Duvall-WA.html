<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
