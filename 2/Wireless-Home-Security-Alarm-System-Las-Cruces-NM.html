The response depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and for how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly.

Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may reveal a 360-degree view, however the very best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or much better. After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I think starts at $0 down.

The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
