<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings underwent extended surveillance.</p>
