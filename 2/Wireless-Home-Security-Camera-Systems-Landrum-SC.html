Simply believe just how much information you hand out when you do an easy online grocery order: your name, your address, the example you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You may even give directions on how to enter your structure. As just recently as 10 years ago, customers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems.
