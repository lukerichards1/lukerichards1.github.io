<p>If an alarm goes off when you're away, this residence Starter Kit will only let you know that there's an emergency situation. If the motion sensing units or entry sensors have actually been set off, it will tell you. Nevertheless, there's no way for you to really see if there's a real problem for you to be fretted about. Is it a false alarm? Has the entry sensor merely been tripped by a family pet or animal? Or do you have something to stress over?

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
