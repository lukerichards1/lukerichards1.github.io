<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control board (normally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours).
