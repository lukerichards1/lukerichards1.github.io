<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
