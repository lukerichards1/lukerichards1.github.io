High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer only expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a Do It Yourself choice. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer service reputation amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this up to the fact that ADT has a number of million more clients than its rivals, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>
<p>One classification where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer care.

<p>Another method to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR).
