<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
