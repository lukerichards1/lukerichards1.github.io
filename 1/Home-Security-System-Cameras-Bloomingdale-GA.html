<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the reality, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and take up a great deal of taping storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>Flood lights are often used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors spot motion, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your home and will potentially frighten burglars. Better outdoor lighting also implies a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, think about the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can deter vandals or frighten them away, however as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
