<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
