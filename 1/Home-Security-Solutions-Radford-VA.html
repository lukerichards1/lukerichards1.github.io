<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning numerous years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>The Ring Stick Up Cam is available in wired and battery variations, which can be utilized indoors and outdoors. But neither can tape continuously, and they both need the Ring Safeguard plan to catch recordings. Likewise, the wired version usually left gaps of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to reduce false signals.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
