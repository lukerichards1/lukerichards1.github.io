<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
