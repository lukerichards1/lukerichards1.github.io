<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
