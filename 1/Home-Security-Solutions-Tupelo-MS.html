<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.
