<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you might also require a neighboring outlet. The majority of cameras require an AC connection, which means you will not have the ability to place them just anywhere.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
