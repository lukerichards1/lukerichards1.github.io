<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
