Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera in addition to a separate power source, implying a more complex setup and more wires.

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at capturing bad guys after they have actually devoted a criminal offense, instead of being able to stop a crime in progress.

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both humans and animals.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
