<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account.

A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long variety situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

The ordinance requires monitored alarm system in unincorporated Douglas County, the city of Castle Pines and the town of Larkspur to be registered and pay an annual $40 authorization cost.
