<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
