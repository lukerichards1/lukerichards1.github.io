<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

<p>In-home consultations are sales chances for security companies.

Although the cameras reviewed in this guide do have basic security features, they can't replace a full home security system, which includes door and window and motion sensors, smoke alarm, and so on.</p>
