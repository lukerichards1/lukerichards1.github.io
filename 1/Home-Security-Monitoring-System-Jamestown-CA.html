<p>When I discuss my deal with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I typically get the Big Bro is enjoying" remark, describing George Orwell's universal socialistic watcher called Big Sibling in his book 1984. This Orwellian" worry is that somebody someplace might be seeing you through a video surveillance camera this very minute and that someone somewhere is abusing the system to breach your flexibility and personal privacy. Luckily, you're not doing anything illegal, just reading this book, and hopefully not behind the wheel of a getaway car, idling in front of a community bank or terrorist target, or speeding through a traffic signal at a high-risk crossway.</p>

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo as much as 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are simple to deal with, it's a bit of a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any clever home hubs or gizmos. A great deal of clever cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
