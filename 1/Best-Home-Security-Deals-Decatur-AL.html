<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
