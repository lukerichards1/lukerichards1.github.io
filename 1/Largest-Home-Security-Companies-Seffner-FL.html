The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with recording gaps throughout crucial security occasions.
