When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
