<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize criminal offense. The Ring Floodlight Webcam combines 2 important gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it turns on its 2 powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording.
