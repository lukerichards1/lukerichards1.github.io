<p>We love that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision choice, but the white and black variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a huge deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- but for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
