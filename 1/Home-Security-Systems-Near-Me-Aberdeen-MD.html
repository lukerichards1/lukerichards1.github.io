It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you zoom in on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment rates is very reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
