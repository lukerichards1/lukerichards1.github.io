<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces.

You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts."
