<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
