<p>Multiple screens were set up within the new command center with a single monitor assigned to alarm displays. Once any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearby camera to that area would be displayed on that particular monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the incident depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can only view one. This produces a one in 3 chance of capturing a specific event on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center likewise consisted of a computer designated for filing event reports online.

<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone informs-- and, in some cases, less incorrect alerts. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area, you won't have to stress over it tape-recording or sending out an alert whenever the pet dog strolls by. (We believe this is a better function if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.)
