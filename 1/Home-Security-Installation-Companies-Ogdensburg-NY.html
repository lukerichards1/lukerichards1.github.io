<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we might review this review.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
