However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they require about 4 times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is essential.</p>
