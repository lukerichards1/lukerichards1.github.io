Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips.

<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
