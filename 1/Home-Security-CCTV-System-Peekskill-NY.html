Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Just a couple decades back, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of huge names offering costly, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.
