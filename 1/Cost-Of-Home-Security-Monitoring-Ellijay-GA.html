<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, ought to supply a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to properly discover motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during important security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest among our top choices, but the Arlo is excellent for checking in on household and pets-- or stray cats slinking around your backyard.</p>

However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
