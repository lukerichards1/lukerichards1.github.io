<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they may be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
