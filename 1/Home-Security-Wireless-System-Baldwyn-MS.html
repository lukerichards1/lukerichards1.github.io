<p>Somewhat more costly than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had been activated. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false informs). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
