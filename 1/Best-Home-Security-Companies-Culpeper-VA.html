If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
