For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software application and firmware.
