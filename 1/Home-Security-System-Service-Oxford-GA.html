A lot of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but couple of make things as simple as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function without any aggravation.</p>
<p>I say sorry to all the Wink fans out there, however to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch.
