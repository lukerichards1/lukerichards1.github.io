<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
