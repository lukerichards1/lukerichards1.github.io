Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

No matter your surveillance system setup, the kind of security camera you pick will have a tremendous effect, and there are many kinds of security cameras out there.
