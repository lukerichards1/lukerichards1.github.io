The first guard got here early so he could look at the entire area and speak with me about my issues. He was professional, considerate and very encouraging. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, reassuring and courteous. We were really delighted with your service and I will recommend that we contact your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
