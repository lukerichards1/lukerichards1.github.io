<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
