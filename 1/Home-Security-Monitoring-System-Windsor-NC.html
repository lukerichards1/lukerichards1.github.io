<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current.

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
