<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
