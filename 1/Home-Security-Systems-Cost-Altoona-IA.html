<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that could match a few of our top choices. It also comes with two days of totally free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
