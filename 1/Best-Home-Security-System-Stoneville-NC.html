The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
