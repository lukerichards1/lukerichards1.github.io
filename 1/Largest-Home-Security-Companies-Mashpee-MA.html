Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is typically an easy process, and it is frequently possible to bring all of your existing gadgets and sensing units to the new wireless system. If you have old hardwired gadgets, you can user interface them with a wireless panel by adding a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>
