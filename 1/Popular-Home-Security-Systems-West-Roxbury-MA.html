<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
