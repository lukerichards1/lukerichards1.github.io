As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
