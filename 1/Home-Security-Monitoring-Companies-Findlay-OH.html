<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
