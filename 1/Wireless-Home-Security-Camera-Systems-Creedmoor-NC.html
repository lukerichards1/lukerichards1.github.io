<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
