IP cameras can likewise be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and offers power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different source of power, indicating a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also typically considered a more secure way to transmit information.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more knowledge to setup, and typically cost more than analog cameras. All sensing units and detectors communicate with a control board. These are available in 2 forms: they can be a physical panel that's set up within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's available and regulated through smart device or tablet.</p>
