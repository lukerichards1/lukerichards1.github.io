If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.

Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
