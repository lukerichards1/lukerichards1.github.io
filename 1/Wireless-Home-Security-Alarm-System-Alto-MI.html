The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the truth, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage space.
