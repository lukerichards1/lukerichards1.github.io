<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building.
