Operators could also start calling a list of phone numbers supplied by the customer to call someone to go examine the secured properties. Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded.

For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary charge.

<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.
