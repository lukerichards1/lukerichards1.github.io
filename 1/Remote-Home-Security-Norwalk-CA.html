<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
