DVRs also require that the linked cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>

<p>How long does it usually require to turn to your alarm monitoring service? I use VOIP today. May move to cellular at some time in the future however staying with dial-up in the meantime. Obviously, you may wish to think about purchasing a security camera or 2 to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a little more costly than Frontpoint's many basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which does not consist of a camera.</p>
