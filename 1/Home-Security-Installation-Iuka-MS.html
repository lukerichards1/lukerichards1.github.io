However that does not mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.
