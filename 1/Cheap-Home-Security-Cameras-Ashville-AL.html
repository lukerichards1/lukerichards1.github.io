<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service implies you don't get alerted up until the next day? The sound may scare off prospective trespassers-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the police won't come up until you personally call them.</p>
<p>A lot of home security cameras perform the exact same basic functions-- they detect an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- however they don't all perform them the very same method. And some cameras have special functions that go beyond those basics. Here are some common functions you'll experience while shopping and why they are very important (we've listed them in alphabetical order). In each of the reviews that follow this purchasers' guide, we'll talk about how each camera provides on these functions.</p>
