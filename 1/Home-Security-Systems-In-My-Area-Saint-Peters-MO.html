Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
