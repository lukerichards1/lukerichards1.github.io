<h3>Wireless Security Alarm System Crozet VA 22932</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to correctly identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with recording gaps during essential security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd recommend one of our top picks, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on family and pets-- or roaming cats slinking around your backyard.</p>
