<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
