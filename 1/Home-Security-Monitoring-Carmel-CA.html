The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
