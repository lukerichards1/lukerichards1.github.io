CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a specific event. An advanced type of CCTV, using digital video recorders (DVRs), offers taping for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance choices and additional functions (such as motion detection and e-mail informs). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, possibly equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording straight to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
