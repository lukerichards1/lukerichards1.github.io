<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for property owners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are often more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your house.
